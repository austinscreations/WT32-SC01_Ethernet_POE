# things to note

With the 86v panel you'd need both the POE module but also the adapter. along with doing modifications to the panel PCB to accept ethernet.
video of doing this modification here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REbtDBVKIto>

even with doing JLCPCBs PCBA you will need to add the ethernet jack - from mouser ARJM11D7-114-AB-EW2
I've been sourcing the POE from aliexpress - it has 2 pins on one end, 4 on the other. 12v output SDAPO DP1435
Then you need an 8 pin 1.25mm dual head JST connector. pinout should be the same pin 1 to pin 1 etc. i've been buying these from aliexpress in 100mmm length

Becuase part numbers and links change somewhat often i won't post any here but feel free to reach out on discord if you need help.
